Please write a web application which enables the user to write "multi-path stories." A multi-path story is composed of sentences. After each sentence, there are up to four possible next sentences, and after each of those, another four possible next sentences, and so on.

Here's a short screencast which illustrates the application:

http://oneis-recruitment.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/stories-web-app.mp4

Take whatever shortcuts you need to make it possible to write the application in a reasonable amount of time, except for code quality. Don't bother with persistence, or making it look nice, but make sure you copy the user interface in the screencast.

Use a very simple server-side web framework to write it, for example, if you wanted to use Python, you might use Flask, with Ruby you might use Sinatra, or if you wanted to use JavaScript, express.js running on node.js. Or feel free to use any other framework you've used before. There should be no JavaScript on the client side.

I suggest you make sure you understand what you need to produce, have a quick think about how to implement it, then leave it for around 24 hours before writing the code.

If you're not sure about anything, please ask before writing any code.

Include instructions for running the application. It will be run on a UNIX-like OS.

Afterwards, write a short report on your approach to designing and implementing this application, the implications of any shortcuts you took, and a list of the things you think this test is testing. This report should be suitable for presentation to one of our clients. Use a simple text based markup language like Textile or Markdown.
